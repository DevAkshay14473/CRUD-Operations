The code runs by making use of sql databases. So firstly these databases needs to be configured.
Then CRUD Operations i.e Create, Read, Update, Delete can be implemented by the codes given in the readme file.

# Running the code

Navigate to the project directory and execute the command python main.py or main.py .
If your Python is configured in the environment variable, your server will start on default port 5000. 
If you want to change the port then you can change the line app.run() to app.run(port=50001), where 5001 is the new port.

You can use Postman, REST Client etc. to test your REST or RESTful APIs
